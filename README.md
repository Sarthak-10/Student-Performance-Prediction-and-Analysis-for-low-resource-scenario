# Student-Performance-Prediction-and-Analysis-for-low-resource-scenario

It is important to develop Student Performance 
prediction software. It helps educational entities 
and institutes in understanding the shortcomings 
of the current educational process and suggests 
improvements in our current system. It can also 
be used to take early precautions in order to
improve studentsâ€™ performance in academic 
endeavors. Another application of such a system 
can be to select the right student for a particular 
task.

We also need to figure out the reasons that lead to 
poor performance of the students. Factors like 
extracurricular activities, illnesses, financial 
problems, and family problems have a major 
effect on students' performance.

We used a dataset, which was collected from two 
Portuguese schools in the subject of Portuguese.
Here we have developed 8 models.
We used both the techniques in permutations of: -
1) using dataset with grades and without grades
2) regression (0-20) and 4-level classification
Furthermore, we also reviewed two research 
papers which predict student performance so as 
to understand techniques used by researchers in 
similar settings.

The detailed results and analysis can be found in the report as well as the slides attached.
